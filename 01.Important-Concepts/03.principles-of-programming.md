# Basics Principles of Programming

- Problem solving
- Clean, readable and maintainable code
- Keeping It Simple
- DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- Documentation

**[GOOD CODE](https://addyosmani.com/blog/good-code/) is like a gift  you pass to the next developer who will maintain it!** üíñ (map üó∫Ô∏è)

The principles of programming encompass fundamental concepts and guidelines that guide the development of software. Here are some key principles:

1. **Clean readability code**: This emphasize the readability, maintainability, and simplicity of code. This is the most crucial aspect of good programming.

1. **KIS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)**: Think of programming like explaining something to a friend. You want to make it as simple as possible so they understand.

   This principle emphasizes simplicity in design and implementation. It suggests that systems should be as simple as possible to minimize complexity and potential errors.

1. **Documentation**: Clear and concise documentation is essential for understanding how software works, its intended use, and its APIs. Good documentation enhances usability and helps collaboration among developers.

   This involves writing **English comments about your code that explain what it does**.

1. **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: In programming, we avoid repeating the same instructions. Instead, we write them once and reuse them whenever needed.

   DRY encourages developers to avoid duplicating code by combining common functionalities into reusable components. This promotes code readability, maintainability, and reduces the risk of **inconsistencies**.

   - Writing functions
   - Avoiding repetition
   - Avoid redundancy by using Data Normalization.
   - Creating modular solutions

1. **Separation of Concerns or Modularity**: When you're solving a big problem, it's easier to break it down into smaller, manageable tasks. In programming, each part of your code should do one job well.

   Picture each part of your code as a separate box. Each box does its own thing without interfering with others. This makes it easier to understand and change one part without messing up the whole program.

   In programming, we keep different parts of the code separate. This design principle involves breaking down larger tasks into smaller units, each responsible for one thing.

   Breaking down a system into smaller, self-contained modules promotes maintainability, reusability, and ease of understanding. Each **module should have a clear purpose and interface**.

1. **Abstraction**: Abstraction involves hiding complex implementation details behind a simplified interface. It allows developers to work at higher levels of understanding without needing to comprehend every detail of a system.

1. **Efficiency**: Efficiency refers to optimizing code to ensure it runs as fast and uses as few resources as possible. Writing efficient code involves considering factors such as time complexity, space complexity, and algorithmic efficiency. As a result, efficient code leads to improved performance, reduced resource consumption, and better overall user experience.

By adhering to these principles, developers can create software that is more robust, maintainable, and adaptable to change.
